### Frontend for database project

This repository is simply a prototype frontend for managing a chat application. The main idea of this repository is an interface for the chat app in which you can chat to anyone who has registed on this website.

To play around with this application, go to [databasefrontend.netlify.app](https://databasefrontend.netlify.app/) and register with an email and a rememberable password (we hold no other data so you can have 123456 as your password). Then you will find a list of all emails that have signed up. You can make another dummy account and open a new tab or browser to try it out!
